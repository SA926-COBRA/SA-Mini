  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use custom models via OpenAI-Compatible API?</summary>

    Yes! For this, open the Menu and change the "Inference Type" to <code>OpenAI-Compatible API</code>. Then configure the Base URL, and optionally set an API Key and a Model to use.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I restrict the access to my MiniSearch instance via password?</summary>
  <p>
    Create a <code>.env</code> file and set a value for <code>ACCESS_KEYS</code>. Then reset the MiniSearch docker container.
  </p>

    For example, if you to set the password to <code>PepperoniPizza</code>, then this is what you should add to your <code>.env</code>:<br/>

<details>
  <summary>Why is MiniSearch built upon SearXNG's Docker Image and using a single image instead of composing it from multiple services?</summary>
  <p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MiniSearch utilizes SearXNG as its meta-search engine.</li>
    <li>Manual installation of SearXNG is not trivial, so we use the docker image they provide, which has everything set up.</li>
    <li>SearXNG only provides a Docker Image based on Alpine Linux.</li>
    <li>The user of the image needs to be customized in a specific way to run on HuggingFace Spaces, where MiniSearch's demo runs.</li>
    <li>HuggingFace only accepts a single docker image. It doesn't run docker compose or multiple images, unfortunately.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I want to serve MiniSearch to other users, allowing them to use my own OpenAI-Compatible API key, but without revealing it to them. Is it possible?</summary>
  <p>Yes! In MiniSearch, we call this text-generation feature "Internal OpenAI-Compatible API". To use this it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Set up your OpenAI-Compatible API endpoint by configuring the following environment variables in your <code>.env</code> file:
      <ul>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_BASE_URL</code>: The base URL for your API</li>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY</code>: Your API access key</li>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_MODEL</code>: The model to use</li>
        <li><code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_NAME</code>: The name to display in the UI</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Restart MiniSearch server.</li>
    <li>In the MiniSearch menu, select the new option (named as per your <code>INTERNAL_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_NAME</code> setting) from the inference type dropdown.</li>
  </ol>
